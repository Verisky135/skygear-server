## How to contribute

Pull Requests Welcome!

We really want to see Skygear grows and thrives in the open source community.
If you have any fixes or suggestions, simply send us a pull request!

### Dependencies

* Golang 1.8
* PostgreSQL 9.5 with PostGIS extension
* Redis
* libsodium, zeromq and czmq if using ZeroMQ as a plugin transport

If using Mac OS X, you can get the ZeroMQ dependencies using Homebrew:

```shell
$ brew install libsodium zeromq czmq
```

### Building from source

```shell
$ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
$ make vendor
$ # export WITH_ZMQ=1 # If you need ZeroMQ support
$ make build
```

#### Building with Nix

Assuming you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) installed,
Skygear can be built with the following command:

```shell
nix-build
```

Build with ZeroMQ support:

```shell
nix-build -E '(import<nixpkgs>{}).callPackage ./default.nix {withZMQ=true;}'
```

You will have a symbolic link `result-bin` linking to the binary.

### Testing

1. Create a PostgreSQL database called `skygear_test` with PostGIS enabled:

```shell
psql -h db -c 'CREATE DATABASE skygear_test;' -U postgres
psql -h db -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;' -U postgres -d skygear_test
psql -h db -c 'CREATE EXTENSION citext;' -U postgres -d skygear_test
```

2. Test case assume the 127.0.0.1 have access to `skygear_test`, add the
following to `pg_hba.conf`:

```
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
```

3. Install golang packages required for testing (check `.travis.yml` for the
   list).

4. Run `go test github.com/skygeario/skygear-server/pkg/...`.

You can also run the test suite in Docker:

```
$ make vendor WITH_DOCKER=1  # install dependencies
$ make before-docker-test    # start dependent services
$ make test WITH_DOCKER=1    # run test
$ make after-docker-test     # clean up docker containers
```
